## Situation
The electric vehicle (EV) market is experiencing rapid growth, driven by technological advancements and increasing environmental concerns. A comprehensive analysis was needed to understand market dynamics, trends, and regional differences in the adoption of EVs in the USA.

## Task
The task was to create a detailed dashboard to analyze the electric vehicle market, including average EV range, market share of Battery Electric Vehicles (BEVs) and Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles (PHEVs), state-wise distribution, CAFV eligibility, top EV manufacturers, and year-over-year (YoY) growth in EV numbers.

## Action
   * Data Collection and Preparation: Gathered data from various reliable sources on EV sales, average ranges, market shares, state-wise distribution, and manufacturer information.
   * Market Analysis: Analyzed the overall EV market, average electric vehicle range, BEV and PHEV market share, and YoY growth in EV numbers across the USA.
   * State-wise Distribution: Identified states with the highest number of electric vehicles.
   * CAFV Eligibility: Assessed which EVs met the Clean Air Vehicle (CAFV) eligibility criteria.
   * Top EV Makers: Analyzed and listed the top manufacturers in the EV market.

## Dashboard Features:
   * Average Line: Implemented an average line to illustrate the average growth trend of EV adoption.
   * Top N Slicer: Used a top N slicer to filter and display the top manufacturers.
   * Conditional Formatting: Applied conditional formatting to highlight key insights and trends for better data visualization.

## Result
The Power BI dashboard provided a clear and comprehensive view of the electric vehicle market. 
-Key insights included_:
1. The average range of electric vehicles.
2. The market share distribution between BEVs and PHEVs.
3. Identification of states leading in EV adoption.
4. EV models meeting CAFV eligibility, aiding stakeholders in making informed decisions.
5. The dominance of top EV manufacturers in the market.
6. Visual representation of YoY growth, demonstrating the accelerating adoption of EVs in the USA.

# Outcome
These insights enabled stakeholders to understand market trends, regional differences, and the competitive landscape, facilitating strategic decision-making.
