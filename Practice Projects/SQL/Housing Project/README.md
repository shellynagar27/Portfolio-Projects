The Nashville Housing Data Cleaning Project aimed to learn and apply SQL techniques for effective data cleaning.

## Tool used
Microsoft SQL Server

## Analysis:
   1. Altering and Updating Tables:
      Used SQL commands to modify the structure of tables and update data as needed. For instance, adding new columns and populating them with transformed data.
   2. Replacing NULL Values:
      Implemented strategies to identify and replace NULL values with appropriate defaults, such as using count() function.

      Performed self-joins to compare rows within the same table, which helped in identifying and handling data inconsistencies and duplicates.
   4. Splitting Columns Using SUBSTRING() and CHARINDEX():
      Employed SUBSTRING() in conjunction with CHARINDEX() to parse and split column values, facilitating data normalization and enhancing query efficiency.
   5. Utilizing PARSENAME() and REPLACE():
      Leveraged PARSENAME() for handling delimited data and REPLACE() for cleaning and standardizing text data within columns.
   6. Removing Duplicate Data:
      Used SQL window functions and other techniques to identify and eliminate duplicate rows, ensuring data integrity and accuracy.
   7.Deleting Unused Columns:
     Optimized the dataset by dropping columns that were redundant or no longer necessary, thus improving database performance and manageability.
