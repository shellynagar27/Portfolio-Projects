# Covid Deaths and Vaccination Data Analysis using SQL
---
The COVID-19 Death and Vaccination Data Analysis Project aimed to explore and analyze data using SQL to answer various questions. 

## Tool
---
Microsoft SQL Server

## Analysis:
   1. Counted Null Values in Continent Column: Identified and counted the number of null values in the continent column to assess data completeness.
   2. Overview of Cases and Deaths: Analyzed the data to get an overview of total cases, new cases, and death cases with respect to population.
   3. Calculated Death and Affected Percentages: Computed the death percentage and affected percentage to understand the impact of COVID-19.
   4. Countries with Highest Infection Rate: Determined which countries have the highest infection rates by comparing the number of cases relative to the population.
   5. Countries with Highest Deaths per Population: Identified countries with the highest death counts per population to gauge the severity of the pandemic in different regions.
   6. Death Percentage in Each Continent: Calculated the death percentage for each continent to understand regional variations in mortality.
   7. Death Rate Among New Cases: Analyzed the death rate among new cases to track the progression and impact of the virus.
   8. Vaccination Percentage: Found out the percentage of the population vaccinated in various countries and regions.
   9. Cumulative and Vaccination Percentage: Calculated cumulative case counts and vaccination percentages to monitor progress over time.
  
## Key Learnings
---
  1. Temporary Tables:
     Learned how to create temporary tables, insert data into them, and use them for intermediate calculations and analyses.
  2. Creating Views:
     Developed skills in creating SQL views to simplify complex queries and enhance data accessibility.
  3. Window Functions:
     Utilized window functions to perform advanced calculations such as running totals, moving averages, and ranking.
     
## Outcome
This project provided a comprehensive understanding of data manipulation, aggregation, and analysis using SQL, enhancing my ability to extract meaningful insights from large datasets.
