I replicated this project from Alex the Analyst youtube video ([link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pixlHHe_lNQ&list=PLUaB-1hjhk8H48Pj32z4GZgGWyylqv85f&index=10))
## Problem Statement
The goal of this project was to provide insights into various data job roles, including factors such as:
- Average age of professionals in data roles
- Work-life balance and salary satisfaction
- Average salary in different data job roles

This analysis aimed to help working professionals, job seekers, and individuals interested in the data field gain clarity on data job roles, salaries, required skills, and overall job satisfaction.

## Aim
To create a comprehensive dashboard for:
- **Working Professionals**: To evaluate job satisfaction and salary metrics.
- **Job Seekers**: To assess potential career paths in data roles.
- **Aspiring Data Professionals**: To gain insights into salary expectations, skills in demand, and job satisfaction in the data industry.

## Steps Taken
1. **Data Cleaning**: Utilized Power Query to clean and transform the survey data.
2. **DAX Calculations**: Created necessary measures using DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) to compute key performance indicators (KPIs) and generate visualizations for the dashboard.

## Key Findings
- The **average age** of survey participants was around **30 years**.
- **Data Scientist roles** were found to be the most difficult to break into, while the **Data Analyst role** was considered the easiest entry point.
- While the **average work-life balance** rating was over **5** (on a scale of 1-10), the **salary satisfaction** rating was **below 5**.
- **Python** was identified as the most preferred programming language among data professionals.
- The majority of survey respondents were from the **USA**.
