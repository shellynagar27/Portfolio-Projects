# Book Store Sales Data Analysis

In this projects we analyze book store sales data as per category, brand, customer, city. We also used recursive query to analyze staff data of the store.


## Tool used

7. brands
8. stores
9. stocks

_Note_: all are .csv files
## Roadmap
1. book_store_sales database is created
2. all csv files are imported
3. ER (entity relationship diagram) is built.
4. Questions were answered using- joins, view, Common Table Expression (CTE), windows functions like- row_number(), dense_rank(), and recursive queries



## Questions which are answered using sql queires
